# André Pitanga

  **Cloud infrastructure built to survive.**

  AWS-native · Terraform-driven · Scale-to-zero


  Currently:
  - SSR at the edge (Nuxt/Nitro on Lambda)
  - Multi-region that's tested and works consitently
  - Security without the performance tax

  **Primitives over abstractions. Understand before you automate.**
