# André Pitanga

**Cloud infrastructure built to survive.**

AWS-native · Terraform-driven · Scale-to-zero

Currently:
- Building [postmodern.](https://pomo.dev) — cloud-native Terraform pattern library
- SSR at the edge (Nuxt/Nitro on Lambda)
- Multi-region that's tested and works consistently

**Primitives over abstractions. Understand before you automate.**
